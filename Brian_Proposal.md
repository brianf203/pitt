## Purpose of Project

### Purpose for Me
The purpose of this project is for me to deepen my understanding of the relationship between sentiment analysis and financial markets. Through this project, I plan to enhance my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. I’m also interested in learning more about how news and social media sentiment can be leveraged to make more informed investment decisions.

### Purpose for Data Team / Panther Equity
This project can be used to provide valuable insights for stock decision-making. By analyzing sentiment in news articles and social media posts, we can identify trends, sentiments, and events that influence stock price movements. This information can help in optimizing investment strategies, contributing toward more informed and data-based decisions.

## Estimated Completion: End of Fall 2023

## Description
This project focuses on using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment in news articles and social media content related to trending stocks. It starts off by gathering historical data on stock prices, news articles, and social media posts related to these stocks, cleaning and filtering information along the way. Using natural language processing tools and sentiment analysis models, sentiments will be made for each news article and social media post. This information will be fed into a machine learning model that compares sentiment data with historical stock prices to make stock predictions, and displayed in a visualization that shows sentiment trends, stock prices, and price predictions.
